##DJI_mobileSDKDocument

This is a third-party DJI mobile SDK document.

I do this because the official one sucks.

Too many _details_ are missing and some functions not available are shown in the official document.

IT SUCKS!

It will be a heavy work and I will upload everything into wiki after finish.


fyi the official ones:

Update June 26:

DJI officially considered rebuild all mobile SDK documents.

https://github.com/dji-sdk/mobile

They told me they would host wiki items in Github and use their website iframe what is in Github.

So I prefer wait and see. If that works, I will delete this repo.
